# Environment Variables in Formula 1 Analysis Project


# API Configuration


# OpenF1 API - No authentication required
# This project uses the OpenF1 API to fetch driver and team metadata
# API Documentation: https://openf1.org/

# Example API usage:
# Base URL: https://api.openf1.org/v1/
# 
# Available endpoints:
# - /drivers?year=2023          Get all drivers from a specific year
# - /sessions?year=2023         Get session information
# - /meetings?year=2023         Get race meeting details
#
# Example code to fetch driver data:
# import requests
# url = "https://api.openf1.org/v1/drivers?year=2023"
# response = requests.get(url)
# if response.status_code == 200:
#     drivers = response.json()
#     # drivers is a list of dictionaries with driver info
#
# No API key needed - the OpenF1 API is completely public


# Database Configuration


# SQLite database file 
# DB_FILE=f1_analysis.db


# Data Directories


# Input data folder (CSV files from Kaggle)
# DATA_DIR=data/

# Output results folder (plots and analysis results)
# RESULTS_DIR=results/


# Notes

# 
# This project does not require any API keys or authentication tokens.
# All data sources are either:
# 1. Local CSV files (downloaded from Kaggle)
# 2. Public APIs (OpenF1 API - no authentication)
#
# If you add other data sources that require authentication in the future,
# add them here following this format:
# API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
